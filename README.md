# project-Ax-b
The below code solves the linear problem Ax=b, when A is an mxn matrix and b a vector mx1.
The code computes the rref form of the augmented matrix [A|b].
Then it checks if the system has solution or not, using the rank of a matrix.
A linear system can have no solution, one solution or infinite many solutions.
The code computes each of the latter two cases
